# sca-project
This repository contains a complete implementation of the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) developed for an academic project on evolutionary computation and optimization techniques.

The goal of this project is to:
   Explain the principles behind the SCA metaheuristic
   Implement the algorithm in Python
   Test it on a benchmark function (Sphere function)
   Provide visualizations of convergence
   Generate AI-powered images and videos for a full presentation

│── sca.py              → Implementation of the SCA algorithm
│── demo.py             → Example run + convergence plot
│── requirements.txt    → Python dependencies

🚀 How to Run the Project:

   1. Install dependencies
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   2. Run the demo script
      python demo.py

This will:
    Print the best fitness, position, and parameters
    Display the convergence curve
